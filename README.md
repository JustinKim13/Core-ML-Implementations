## ðŸ“Œ Core ML Implementations
Reimplemented Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch
This repository contains from-scratch implementations of fundamental machine learning algorithms and concepts. The goal is to strengthen my understanding of core ML mathematics and implementation details by avoiding high-level libraries like scikit-learn.

## ðŸš€ Why This Exists
* âœ… Deepen my understanding of ML theory and math
* âœ… Implement core algorithms without relying on black-box libraries
* âœ… Improve problem-solving and algorithmic thinking

Each implementation is built from the ground up using minimal high-level libraries, following rigorous mathematical derivations.
